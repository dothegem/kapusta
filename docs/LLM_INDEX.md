# LLM Index (Taxonomy)

Use this file as the first entry-point for AI/LLM agents.

## Canonical docs (read first)
- `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` — product spec: UI, entities, storage model, workflows, formulas for BG, naming. 
- `docs/CALC_LOGIC.md` — unified calculator formulas + verification values.
- `docs/ARCH_GUIDELINES.md` — architectural rules (plugin protocol target, module size limits, migration rules).
- `docs/PROJECT_TAXONOMY.md` — codebase map and responsibilities.
- `docs/context.md` — rolling session log (append-only; keep it short and factual).

## Repo policy
- `.info/` is deprecated and must not exist in the repository.
- All development context lives under `docs/`.
